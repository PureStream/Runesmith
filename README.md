# The Runesmith
The Runesmith is a Slay the Spire modded character centered around upgrading cards and creating runes. Elements can be gained from various cards and are required to craft powerful runes. These runes grant various passive effect akin to The Defect's orbs. Her cards can become extremely powerful, however they require lengthy setups. 
This mod is early in development but most of the cards have been implemented. Expect many changes and balancing in the near future. 
Most of the arts are temporary and will be updated as more refined drawings are made. Character animation is also in the works.
## Mechanics
**Enhance**: Enhance allows cards to be powered up beyond what a card upgrade could do. Enhance effect is consumed after an enhanced card is played.

**Stasis**:  Prevent a card from being exhausted once and the card gets discarded instead. Stasis can't be stacked. 

**Downgrade**: Some cards are powerful relative to its energy cost. As as side effect, these cards will downgrade your other cards. Downgrading remove (one level of) upgrade, (all) enhancement and stasis.

**Elements**: Several cards grant elements (Ignis, Terra, Aqua) after use. These elements are crafting ingredients for runes and also used for other utilities.

**Rune**: Runes can be created using specified amount of elements. Runes grant many type of passive effect from dealing damage to gaining extra cards.

  **Craft**: Crafting creates runes using elements.
  
**Potency**: Some runes have a potency value attached to them. The power of these runes are determined by this value when they are crafted. Potency cannot modify the power of active runes.

**Break**: Destroys a rune and activate its effect twice.
